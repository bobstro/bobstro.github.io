# Comfort and tips

## Body changes
Your body is going to go through some dramatic changes due to treatment and symptoms. Be prepared for these up front as much as possible.
### Weight loss
Weight loss was one of the symptoms that triggered my diagnosis (specifically a CT scan). I rapidly dropped more than 30 lbs., going from slightly overweight to emaciated within months. 
My biggest mistake was not being more outspoken about the need to address my inability to intake food. It was only after 6 weeks that the use of Pancreatic Enzymes to improve digestion was started. That has given me the biggest relief and allowed my diet to return to somewhat normal.
### The Port
The Port is planted under the skin of your chest to allow ready access to your circulatory system without the need for repeated Intravenous (IV) needles. Get this without delay.
Mine, unfortunately, did cause some initial discomfort, making sleeping on my right side difficult for some weeks, but this has gradually lessened.
## Sleep
Sleep is going to be difficult. If you're a side sleeper like me, this may be one of the most difficult adjustments. Between the pain of the hospital bed making left side sleeping impossible to the Port making the right difficult, I finally had to adjust to sleeping on my back.
### Recliner
Ideally, find a good recliner or bed arrangement that lets you sleep with your head somewhat elevated. This helps with sleep and digestion.
### Large foam pillow
I cannot overemphasize how comforting a large, long foam pillow is for this adjustment. I recommend the Coop brand, but there are many others available. The main thing is that it should be long enough to extend from your hips to your ear when laid alongside you at night.
### Pseudo-side sleeping
If you're a life-long side sleeper such as myself, adjusting to sleeping on your back may be difficult. I discovered that I can create a comfortable "pseudo" side position by laying the pillow along either side and reaching back with the other hand to pull it behind my head. This creates a cushion that feel much like sleeping on the side, and at least lets me get a few hours of uninterrupted sleep.
## Ambient noise
I have mixed results with white noise or other ambient noise generators for sleep. They can be soothing, but also get tedious. Don't hesitate to try several different programs o your smartphone if that's an option.
